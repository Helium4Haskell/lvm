synopsis:               The Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) Runtime System.
homepage:               http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/Helium/WebHome
description:

   The Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) defines a portable instruction set and file
   format. It is specifically designed to execute languages with non-strict (or
   lazy) semantics. This cabal package defines an LVM runtime written in C. 
   The core assembler (coreasm) for compiling core programs into LVM instructions 
   and a library is defined in the lvmlib cabal package. The LVM is used 
   as a backend for the Helium compiler. More information about LVM can be 
   found in Chapter 6 of Daan Leijen's PhD Thesis, The Lambda Abroad.

   We use the Make build-type here. The dependencies are provided in the Cabal
   file, and their generation is not handled by Cabal. Instead, if you change 
   dependencies please run `make depend'. This occurs extremely rarely, though,
   because we do not plan to evolve lvmrun.
   
   Fornothing.hs is only there to please Cabal.
