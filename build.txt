Building the runtime system.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) goto the "src" subdirectory

> cd src

2) Run the configure script. This generates three files in
the subdirectory "config", namely "makefile", "s.h" (system)
and "m.h" (machine).

> ./configure

Trouble shooter:
* Make sure that the shell program "sh" can be found. On cygwin
  you sometimes need to copy "bash.exe" to "/bin/sh.exe" to make it work
* Make sure that all the scripts are executable:
  > chmod +x configure
  > cd config/tests
  > chmod +x config.guess config.sub runtest hasgot searchpath
  > cd ../..

Windows:
  You can skip this step if you want to build it
  using Microsoft Visual C. Otherwise, you need to install
  the "cygwin" toolkit first. You should use the
  option "-host i386-pc-windows" when running configure.

3) Go to the "runtime" subdirectory and run make.

> cd runtime
> make depend
> make

Windows: If you are using VC++, you can click on the runtime
workspace file "runtime.dsw" and build it with Visual Studio.

4) This builds the LVM runtime, "lvmrun". You can test it on
some test files in the "test" subdirectory.

> cd ../../test/std
> ../../src/runtime/lvmrun sieve

5) You may want to set the environment variable "LVMPATH" to
point to directories that contain ".lvm" files.

> export LVMPATH=/users/daan/lvm/test/std

or

> setenv LVMPATH /home/daan/lvm/test/std


------------------------------------------------------------
Building the core assembler.
------------------------------------------------------------

1) You need the Parsec library available at:

http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html

Make sure that it is on the Hugs path. If you use
GHC you should edit the "src/coreasm/makefile" file such
that GHC can find the parsec library.

  ....
  #Libraries
  LIBPATH  = c:/parsec/src
  LIBS     = Parsec
  ...

2) Make it with GHC:

> cd src/coreasm
> make depend
> make

or run it from Hugs:

> cd src/coreasm
> hugs Main.hs
